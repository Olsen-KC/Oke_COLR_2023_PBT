# Oke_COLR_2023_PBT
## Objective: Use genotyping-in-thousands (GT-seq) to characterize the genetic diversity of 2023 Big Creek Hatchery broodstock and conduct parentage based tagging (PBT) of spring 2023 Chum salmon outmigrant fry and 2023 adult returns in the Lower Columbia River. 
## GT-seq_genotyping_output: initial outputs from GT-seq genotyping of 2023 adult returns and 2023 spring outmigrant fry. Marker info file and original genotypes.
## metadata_WDFW_genotypes: metadata file for 2023 adult returns and 2023 spring outmigrant fry genotyped by SFGL in 2024. WDFW genotype file for samples from 2013 - 2022.
## filtering_and_analyses: R markdown html records of qaulity filtering and merging SFGL - WDFW GT-seq genotypes. Filtered genotype file. R markdown html record of diversity and parentage analyses. Folders for Genepop and Colony input and results files.
